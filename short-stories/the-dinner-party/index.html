        <h1>The Dinner Party</h1>
        <p>
            Three muffled knocks could be heard from the kitchen of the apartment.
            James (age 9), who is currently peering into the oven window to check the maple-glaze on his roasting parsnips, sits up with delight.
            The first dinner party guest has arrived!
        </p>
        <p>
            James calls his younger brother (Charles, age 5) and older sister (Sasha, age 11) over to the front door in preparation for the <!-- Odd phrasing -->zingy<!----> welcome.
            James and Sasha, eyeing the entryway's mirror, make some last minute adjustments to their hair using their fingers as combs.
            Charles, much too young to care about such matters, stands idly by and looks at them slightly bemused.
            After fixing her own hair, Sasha crouches down to fix the stray hairs on Charles with a few firm pats.
            With the conclusion of the <!-- Primping -->ceremonial hoopla<!---->, they were finally prepared to greet the awaiting guest.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sasha flings the front door open to be greeted by a girl, bundled in the heaviest winter wear, affixed with a bottle of pomegranate juice.
            Charles squeezes himself between Sasha and the slightly ajar door.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Sophia! Glad you could make it!" exclaimed Sasha.
            Everyone usually calls her Fia for short, except in times of jubilation (and vexation).
        </p>
        <p>
            Charles lunges at Fia's torso, fastening his arms around her.
            She looks at him with endearment, admiring the youth's innocence.
            In reality, Fia was only four months and seven days his senior, but liked to act older, perhaps to fit into the imagined clique of grown-ups consisting of James and Sasha.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fia hands Sasha the bottle of pomegranate juice as a welcoming gift, flicks off her sneakers, and removes her winter wear to reveal her signature oversized purple sweater.
        </p>
        <p>
            The siblings and Fia gab, mentions of weather and weekend plans pervading the mindless chatter.
            <!--
            It is not obvious what I am trying to say here.
            Say that they are holding back these stories because, if they shared them now, then they would either have to repeat themselves when the other guests arrive, or have the absent guests not hear what they had to say. -->
            Many of them had some interesting tidbits or stories that they desired to share that evening, but did not want to repeat themselves to the guests yet to come, or worse, have the absentees miss what they had to say altogether.
        </p>
        <p>
            A <!-- Dated phrasing -->jaunty<!----> rhythm permeates through the apartment.
            With only two dinner guests being invited, it must be Ayesha (age 9) at the door.
            Flocking to the entrance, <!-- Too technical/engineering-y -->their assumption was proved correct<!---->.
            In addition to our final dinner guest, was a cinnamon babka tucked under her arm.
        </p>
        <p>
            Further gabbing ensues, with some of the pre-prepared tidbits and stories now seeping into the conversation.
            Nibbling of appetisers and sipping of drinks fill the brief lulls.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            The gabbing continues while the guests begin migrating from the living room to the dinner table.
            A side conversation between Charles and Fia attract the attentions of the others.
            "Honeydew watermelons are great!" proclaims Fia, with a retaliation of "All it is is a worse version of a cantaloupe!" by Charles.
            Soon the table was split into two camps: honey-do's and honey-don'ts.
            The mention of the watermelons in fruit salad suddenly turns the debate into a ruckus.
        </p>
        <p>
            Knock.
            Knock.
        </p>
        <p>
            Everyone looks bemused, clinking glances.
            James hesitantly walks to the door.
        </p>
        <p>
            KNOCK.
            KNOCK.
            KNOCK.
        </p>
        <p>
            The urgency of the situation elevates with each thump of the oak.
        </p>
        <p>
            James slowly opens the door, but before he could get a peek at the cause of all this commotion, a large, garish boy barges in.
        </p>
        <p>
            His outfit is overwhelming to say the least: brown clogs, purple knee-high socks, rainbow-striped shorts (possibly a few centimetres *too* short), a tattered rope belt, a white faux-fur coat, and a fedora.
            His whole attire is both fascinating and horrifying, causing the eye to be unnaturally drawn to the phenomena that is his dress sense.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sasha remembers who it is.
            It's Duke Bottlethog from the apartment down the hall, and to abate any confusion, whispers this to the others.
            They nod in understanding, because with a name like that, his presence seemed to make sense.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Oh harumph!" howls Duke Bottlethog.
        </p>
        <p>
            He then begins to mutter to himself, "I've done it this time…", "She can't be that far…", "Silly silly me…".
            James tries to interject, but is unheard through these ramblings.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, when James asks (for the umpteenth time) what he is doing here, Duke Bottlethog exclaims "She's gone! They've taken sweet Tunipa away! Woe is me!"
            The group didn't know who "they" were, nor who "Tunipa" was, but there was one thing they did know for certain: the honeydew watermelon debate would have to wait.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            "I'm sorry Duke, we haven't seen Tunipa anywhere," explained Sasha.
        </p>
        <p>
            Duke Bottlethog swivelled his neck to look directly at Sasha.
            "It's <b>Duke</b> Bottlethog! Not Duke. Not Bottlethog. But Duke Bottlethog!"
            He began to mutter under his breath how a couple of rumbustious kids were recently tormenting him, chanting "Bottle Hog, Bottle Hog, legs so long he looks like a frog." No one daren't say anything.
        </p>
        <p>
            "You know Tunipa, she wouldn't hurt a fly!" exclaimed Duke Bottlethog.
            The group feared it was too late to ask who Tunipa was now, out of fear of further upsetting Duke Bottlethog.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                One of them says "Wouldn't it be "Duke <i>of</i> Bottlethog"?. Not just "Duke Bottlethog"?. And also, when Sash referred to him as "Duke", isn't that perfectly fine? Not that I perfectly understand the point of these sort of titles anyway, but I just don't get the outrage". Someone else says, "To be honest, I'm guessing he's not <i>actually</i> a Duke…".

                <!--
                This all feels a bit to harsh for a children's story.
                But still, I'd like to get this point across, as we can learn two things:
                    1.  Duke Bottlethog is a self-proclaimed Duke.
                        He wasn't born into anything.
                    2.  It demonstrates that one (or two) of the characters are kind of no it all's.
                -->
            </li>
            <li>
                The group (and the reader) think that Tunipa is a cat (Sophie remembers that a neighbor has a cat and was asking people to look after it while the neighbor was on holiday, and assumes that Tunipa is the cats name), and someone has taken her, but infact they are the Duke's tulips that he has been caring for while his friend went on holiday.
                Duke is annoyed at himself as this was the only thing he was responsible for.
                The group asks the Duke about Tunipa (thinking it's the cat), and Duke replies (thinking that the group knows it's his plant).
                Duke gets bemused by the group, as they are looking for Tunipa where a cat would be, but it would obviously be somewhere a plant would be.
                The terminology is vague enough that both of them think they know what eachother are talking about.
                Finally, a question or response results in one of them being confused (e.g., the group asking about what Tunipa eats or something), then the kerfuffle is resolved by Duke exclaiming that he was
                "obviously" talking about the Tulips
            </li>
            <li>
                The group decide to help Duke look for Tunipa.
                James tries to ask them to wait after they have finished eating as he spent all day making the food, but everyone decides against it.
            </li>
            <li>
                They all search his apartment up and down
            </li>
            <li>
                James is sad that his food is getting cold
            </li>
            <li>
                …
            </li>
            <li>
                They somehow(?) bump into the friend who returns from holiday
            </li>
            <li>
                Duke cries and rambles (as he previously did) on how he took such good care of it, but at some point it was lost, and quickly says the highlights of their search the group went through
            </li>
            <li>
                The friend says she took Tunipa earlier and they are fine now.
                (why did she take them earlier? Maybe she saw them on the window sill of his apartment and decided to take them as tulips shouldn't get too much sunlight? Would only make sense if he was on the first floor).
            </li>
            <li>
                James is still sad about his food
            </li>
            <li>
                They all realise his sadness and make him a meal (the gang, Duke, and the friend).
            </li>
        </ul>
