<!--        Just list the projects that I've done like that bear blog did, e.g., "Reverse Chronilogical Order". I can put an "Under construction" label/emoji next to projects I'm working on. Leave the ideas thing for now as I just want to push my website out there!-->

<!--            <h2>Ideas ðŸ’­</h2>-->
<!--            <p>A list of random ideas that I have (mostly programming related). Some ideas are more fleshed out than others, and is mostly just a personal knowledge graph that I'm making public. These are all things that I'm thinking/thought about, and should mostly be ignored, unless there's something that peaks your interest. If there is anything here that you'd like to discuss, then please reach out! I'd be happy to talk about any of the things below. Many of us keep our half-baked (or even un-baked) ideas to ourselves, so I just want to try and share them and see if anything comes of it. Some of the notes here are on projects that I'm working on. If that's the case, it's mostly here to be deleted as it'll either be implemented within the project, or will be scrapped because they don't make sense. Expect certain things to be edited often as I'm working on them, while other things to be untouched as I've shelved them or not gotten round to doing anything about them. Some will be turned into blog entries, and hence be more thought out than whatever is here.</p>-->
<!--            <p>A collection of project ideas that I've had. I will hopefully get around to implementing some of these and I'll promote them to the "Implementing" section, but in the meantime, if you're interested in any of them, feel free to reach out to me as I'd be very happy to discuss them. Almost none of them have any financial viability, and are usually idelogoical in some way (e.g., towards an open internet, improving learning for all). If you're interested in adopting some concepts or the whole idea, please feel free. All I ask for is some small amount of recognition (a small shoutout somewhere) but I won't enforce it.</p>-->
