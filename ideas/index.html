        <h1>Ideas</h1>
        <p>A list of random ideas that I have (mostly programming related). Some ideas are more fleshed out than others, and is mostly just a personal knowledge graph that I'm making public. These are all things that I'm thinking/thought about, and should mostly be ignored, unless there's something that peaks your interest. If there is anything here that you'd like to discuss, then please reach out! I'd be happy to talk about any of the things below. Many of us keep our half-baked (or even un-baked) ideas to ourselves, so I just want to try and share them and see if anything comes of it. Some of the notes here are on projects that I'm working on. If that's the case, it's mostly here to be deleted as it'll either be implemented within the project, or will be scrapped because they don't make sense. Expect certain things to be edited often as I'm working on them, while other things to be untouched as I've shelved them or not gotten round to doing anything about them. Some will be turned into blog entries, and hence be more thought out than whatever is here.</p>
