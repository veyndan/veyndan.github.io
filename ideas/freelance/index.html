            <h1>Freelancing</h1>
            <p>I was looking into how to freelance in Germany as a British expat who moved here before Brexit was finalised. I ended up not pursuing freelance, but I had many questions where I think I had good answers to them at the time, so I'm putting it here in case anyone finds it useful. This was put together in the Summer of 2021, so it may or may not be outdated.</p>

                <summary>Found a mistake, have an addition, or have a question?</summary>
                As always, if there are issues that you found, please make the edit here and change it, or just send me an email saying what is wrong. If you have extra information you'd like to contribute, you can also add that. If you think this information is useful somewhere else and it doesn't profit a company in doing so (e.g., StackOverflow profits a company, whereas Wikipedia doesn't in loose terms), then I'll be happy to move it to those pages instead if it's more discoverable than my website.

                <h3>Does {my employer} allow me to freelance while working?</h3>
                <p>Check your employment contract about whether you're allowed to do this. For example, at my last employment I must've gotten written consent of the Employer. If that's the case, then there might be specific things they'd like to know about your freelancing gigs.</p>

                <h3>Does my residency permit allow me to freelance (and work)?</h3>

                <p>Yes, my residency permit allows me to freelance.</p>

                <h3>What are the maximum number of hours I can freelance?</h3>
                <p>According to the <a href="http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/arbzg/BJNR117100994.html">Arbeitszeitgesetz</a> (”Working Hours Act”), a working day is defined as Monday to Saturday, as one legally cannot work on a Sunday or public holiday. The maximum number of hours one can work per working day is 10 hours, averaging out at 48 hours per week over the course of 24 weeks.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    § 3 Working hours of employees

                    The working hours of employees shall not exceed eight hours per working day. It may be extended to up to ten hours only if an average of eight hours per working day is not exceeded within six calendar months or within 24 weeks.

                <p><a href="https://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/faqs/EN/topics/constitution/brexit/faqs-brexit.html">According to BMI</a>, I am able to switch over to being self-employed without notifying the authorities.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    You can use the document to prove that you are residing in Germany legally and that you are allowed to work in Germany. For example, this allows you to switch from employment to self-employed economic activity or vice versa without having to notify or obtain permission from the foreigners authority.
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                    I must, however, be able to support myself during this time, otherwise I risk losing my right of residence. Regaining my right of residence is not possible.
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    Loss of your right of residence is also possible if you no longer fulfil the requirements for it: for example if you do not yet have a right of permanent residence, if you lose your job, if you have not found a new job within six months, if there is no reasonable prospect that you will find a job in Germany and if you do not have sufficient resources to support yourself.

                    If you have lost your right of residence under the Withdrawal Agreement, you cannot regain it.

                <p>
                    Yes, my residency permit allows me to switch to freelancing. However, I must be able to support myself during this time, otherwise I risk losing my right of residence.
