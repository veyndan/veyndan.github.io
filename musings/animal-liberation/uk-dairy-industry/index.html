    <h1>UK Dairy Industry</h1>
    <p>
      My passionate plea to do something helpful was recently reignited after watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cow_(2021_film)">Cow</a>.
      In a similar vein to the film, instead of focusing on the whole industry, perhaps I should narrow my focus.
      Similarly again, myself having been brought up in Somerset, around mostly dairy farms, I feel that it'd be natural to focus my attention on the UK dairy industry.
      To be able to noticeably reduce the consumption of dairy within the UK would be a great task.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could obviously go out in the streets and pass around fliers, pleading people to stop consuming dairy.
      I'm not trying to bash these people, but I individually want to make a bigger difference.
      In order to do so, I feel that I need to deeply understand the industry.
      It's inner workings.
      It's trends.
      It's dark secrets.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to do this, I want to first ask some probing questions about the industry, and then hopefully be able to answer them.
    </p>

      <h2>Why are you only focusing on the one country's dairy industry?</h2>
      <p>
        To have a deep understanding of a single country's dairy industry is a huge undertaking for a single person.
        To have a deep understanding of the dairy industry for multiple countries' is an astronomical task.
        Realistically, I'd end up having a shallow understanding of all the countries' in question.
      </p>

      <h2>Why aren't you focusing on another country?</h2>
      <p>
        I was born and raised in England, so it feels like a natural choice.
        I am currently living in Germany, but I'm not a citizen of Germany, nor do I speak German, so it'd be a much harder endeavour.
        Focusing on any other country wouldn't have the same immediacy to me.

      <h2>The Questions</h2>
      <p>All the questions are in the context of the UK.</p>
      <p>The list of questions will evolve as I learn about the industry. I'll add/modify questions whenever.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>How elastic is the demand for milk?</li>
        <li>How elastic is the demand for plant milks?</li>
        <li>What dairy subsidies are in place?</li>
        <li>How prevalent is (dairy) lobbying?</li>
        <li>How does the choice of cattle affect cattle and the production of dairy?</li>
        <li>What factors (e.g., the price of cattle feed) affect the price of milk?</li>
        <li>Can the regained land away from dairy cows be more productive, e.g., at producing another crop or for housing?</li>
        <li>How cheap could milk alternatives be (e.g., we have a vertically integrated business where we grow crops, process, and sell, and don't care for profit. Assume we can price fix like Coke did with the 5cent coke)?</li>
        <li>How expensive <i>should</i> milk be if not for lobbying (or other things)?</li>
        <li>
          How does the flow of money in dairy production look?
          Consider something like: the cost of bedding (straw, sawdust, sand); the cost of different feeds.
          Also, we need to see how much of one good affects the price of other goods, e.g., sawdust isn't only used for dairy bedding, so we don't want to increase it if it negatively affects another industry that may be good.
        </li>
        <li>Who mostly purchases milk, e.g., a particular industry, or consumers?</li>
        <li>Which demographic has the highest milk consumption? The lowest? How has this changed over the years?</li>
      </ul>
