        <h1>Animal Liberation</h1>
        <p>
            I've been a lifelong vegetarian, and have been vegan since 2013.
            I'm a vegan for purely ethical reasons.
            I've always been a proponent of animal welfare, yet have never done anything meaningful towards it, apart from changing my own habits.
            I'd like to do more.
        </p>

            <h2>Scope</h2>
            <p>
                Liberating all animals from the unnecessary suffering that humanity imparts is obviously <em>too large</em> a goal for a single person.
                Trapping and transferring the occasional spider from my living room to outside is obviously <em>too small</em> a goal.
                I want something somewhere in the middle.
            </p>
            <p>
                I will focus on the UK dairy industry
            </p>
<!--            <p>-->
<!--                I want to focus on animal agriculture, as I believe that the area is the largest contributor to animal suffering,-->
<!--                and that it's the area that I can potentially contribute to as it's more of a question of economics than human psychology (for example, animal abuse).-->

            <h2>How can I help significantly as an individual?</h2>
            <p>
                Doing something that meaningfully reduces the amount of animal suffering has always been elusive to me, but the industry is so large so I feel like a small fish, and is so out of my areas of expertise that I don't know how my skill set can help combat it.
                Usually when there is a problem I'm faced with, I can usually reduce it down to a problem that can be solved through programming, and hence actually have a go at solving it.
                To reduce the size of the animal agriculture industry, the only programming related things I believe could help are making websites for animal liberation groups for free.
                This isn't the 90s, and most non-technical people should be able to get a basic website up and running via any number of platforms.
                Not super helpful.
            </p>
            <p>
                My passionate plea to do something helpful was recently reignited after watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cow_(2021_film)">Cow</a>.
                In a similar vein to the film, instead of focusing on the whole industry, perhaps I should narrow my focus.
                Similarly again, myself having been brought up in Somerset, around mostly dairy farms, I feel that it'd be natural to focus my attention on the UK dairy industry.
                To be able to noticeably reduce the consumption of dairy within the UK would be a great task.
            </p>
            <p>
                I could obviously go out in the streets and pass around fliers, pleading people to stop consuming dairy.
                I'm not trying to bash these people, but I individually want to make a bigger difference.
                In order to do so, I feel that I need to deeply understand the industry.
                It's inner workings.
                It's trends.
                It's dark secrets.
            </p>
            <p>
                In order to do this, I want to first ask some probing questions about the industry, and then hopefully be able to answer them.
            </p>

            <h2>What should I focus on?</h2>
            <p>
                Counterintuitively, I believe that to have a significant effect, I must focus on a specific area of the business.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>Why are you only focusing on the one country's dairy industry?</h2>
            <p>
                To have a deep understanding of a single country's dairy industry is a huge undertaking for a single person.
                To have a deep understanding of the dairy industry for multiple countries' is an astronomical task.
                Realistically, I'd end up having a shallow understanding of all the countries' in question.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Why aren't you focusing on another country?</h2>
            <p>
                I was born and raised in England, so it feels like a natural choice.
                I am currently living in Germany, but I'm not a citizen of Germany, nor do I speak German, so it'd be a much harder endeavour.
                Focusing on any other country wouldn't have the same immediacy to me.
