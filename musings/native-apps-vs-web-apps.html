        <h1>User facing differences in mobile apps vs mobile websites</h1>
        <p>
            People often say that native apps are better than web apps.
            Let's compare them.
        </p>
        <section>
            <h2>Mobile apps use native UI components</h2>
            <p>
                If we think of native UI components as the "theme" for the OS,
                then it doesn't seem wild to think that this theme can be replicated for the web.
                Material Design has web components, to allow just this.
                They are notably worse than the android counterpart, but that can be overcome.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>Mobile apps have better performance than websites</h2>
            <p>
                This difference isn't felt by tiny apps,
                but can once you're getting to larger scale.
                This can be mitigated to a neglible degree through the use of web components.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Mobiles have app stores</h2>
            <p>
                This is basically just a web portal for websites, but polished up.
                I think this could be good for the web, to have a curated experience, where things like PWAs are elevated.
                Microsoft Store is basically doing this with showcasing PWAs on the desktop.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>Mobile apps have hooks for all the sensors that web doesn't</h2>
            <p>
                This is a big one.
                Web is catching up but isn't there yet.
                We should push for this on the web,
                but for most apps, they aren't using anything interesting in terms of camera or sensors and stuff.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>Mobile apps have better retention</h2>
            <p>
                For a normal user, who cares.
                This gives normal users the ability to check out other products.
                Ultimately, web apps give more freedom to the user, as they can choose what they look at without jumping through unnecessary hurdles (having to download and wait for apps to be installed).
                Users can still just use the core set of web apps if they want to.
                All this gives is the <b>freedom</b> to do otherwise.
                We also shouldn't give a shit that the company behind the app wants to increase retention as a user.
                Technology should be driven by users and developers, not product managers and shareholders.
