	<h1>What's left to say?</h1>
	<p>
		It's not talking into the void but more taking in a crowd.
		No one's listening, and nor should they have to.
		Is there value in adding to the chatter?
		Am I just taking over people with more interesting things to say?
	</p>
	<p>
		The irony of this post being published in the first place is not lost on me.
		I suppose the answer to the question is whether reading this post gave you any value?
