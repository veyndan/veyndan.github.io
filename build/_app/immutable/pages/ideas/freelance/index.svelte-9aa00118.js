        <p>I was looking into how to freelance in Germany as a British expat who moved here before Brexit was finalised. I ended up not pursuing freelance, but I had many questions where I think I had good answers to them at the time, so I&#39;m putting it here in case anyone finds it useful. This was put together in the Summer of 2021, so it may or may not be outdated.</p>
