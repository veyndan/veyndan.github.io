    <p>A list of random ideas that I have (mostly programming related). Some ideas are more fleshed out than others, and is mostly just a personal knowledge graph that I&#39;m making public. These are all things that I&#39;m thinking/thought about, and should mostly be ignored, unless there&#39;s something that peaks your interest. If there is anything here that you&#39;d like to discuss, then please reach out! I&#39;d be happy to talk about any of the things below. Many of us keep our half-baked (or even un-baked) ideas to ourselves, so I just want to try and share them and see if anything comes of it. Some of the notes here are on projects that I&#39;m working on. If that&#39;s the case, it&#39;s mostly here to be deleted as it&#39;ll either be implemented within the project, or will be scrapped because they don&#39;t make sense. Expect certain things to be edited often as I&#39;m working on them, while other things to be untouched as I&#39;ve shelved them or not gotten round to doing anything about them. Some will be turned into blog entries, and hence be more thought out than whatever is here.</p>
